`Gerbers` for the enclosure panels are in the subfolder [/ksoloti-gills_panel/jlcpcb/production_files](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/tree/main/ksoloti-gills_panel/jlcpcb/production_files)
Although the Kicad project includes all panels, there is one gerber zip per panel: top, bottom, left, right, front, rear. If you have made edits and want to update the Gerbers, you will need to create separate Gerbers by pasting each relevant single panel in a temporary PCBNew window and `File->Plot...` it from there. Or so.
Note that there are two `ksoloti-gills-panel-top-*.zip`, one for black color, one for white. The silkscreens differ.
