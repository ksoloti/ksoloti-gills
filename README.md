# ksoloti-gills
# CAD project and Gerbers for Ksoloti Gills v0.6


# Kicad 9.0!




## This is just the Gills unit (and CV expander) and will not work without a Ksoloti Core plugged in.


# Gills PCB
`Gerbers`, `BOM` and `CPL` files for the PCB are in the subfolder [/jlcpcb/production_files](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/tree/main/jlcpcb/production_files)


Schematics are [here](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/blob/main/ksoloti-gills_v06.pdf)

Human-readable BOM with notes and links is [here](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/blob/main/ksoloti-gills_v06_bom.xlsx)

# Gills Enclosure Panels

`Gerbers` for the enclosure panels are in the subfolder [/ksoloti-gills_panel/jlcpcb/production_files](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/tree/main/ksoloti-gills_panel/jlcpcb/production_files)
Although the Kicad project includes all panels, there is one gerber zip per panel: top, bottom, left, right, front, rear. If you have made edits and want to update the Gerbers, you will need to create separate Gerbers by pasting each relevant single panel in a temporary PCBNew window and `File->Plot...` it from there. Or so.
Note that there are two `ksoloti-gills-panel-top-*.zip`, one for black color, one for white. The silkscreens differ.

# Gills CV Expander PCB
`Gerbers`, `BOM` and `CPL` files for the CV Expander PCB are in the subfolder [/ksoloti-gills-cv-expander/jlcpcb/production_files](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/tree/main/jlcpcb/production_files)


CV Expander Schematics are [here](https://github.com/ksoloti/ksoloti-gills/blob/main/ksoloti-gills-cv-expander/ksoloti-gills-cv-expander_v03.pdf)

BOM parts required for CV Expander are included in the main BOM (xlsx) above.
